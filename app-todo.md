# Proposal Builder App Development To-Do List
This to-do list outlines the steps to build the SaaS Proposal Builder app, a web-based application for creating professional proposals with a multi-step form, real-time preview, AI text generation, and PDF/Word export functionality.

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Planning

- Define project scope and finalize requirements based on user feedback.
- Set up a project management tool (e.g., Trello, Jira) to track tasks.
- Create a Git repository for version control (e.g., GitHub).
- Choose the technology stack:
    - Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS, React Router.
    - Backend: Node.js with Express.js or Firebase.
    - Database: MongoDB or Firebase Firestore.
    - AI: xAI API for text generation.
    - Export: jsPDF (PDF), docx.js (Word).
- Set up development environment (e.g., VS Code, Node.js, npm).
- Configure hosting platform (e.g., AWS, Vercel, Firebase Hosting).
- Create a basic project structure with folders for frontend, backend, and shared utilities.

## Phase 2: Backend Development

- Set up the backend server (Node.js/Express or Firebase).
- Configure the database (MongoDB or Firestore) with schemas for:
- Users (email, password, profile).
- Proposals (form data, metadata, draft status).
- Templates (predefined styles/content).
- Implement user authentication:
- Email/password login/signup.
- OAuth integration (Google, Microsoft).


 Create API endpoints for:
User management (create, update, delete).
Proposal CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete).
Template retrieval.
Saving drafts (manual and auto-save).


 Integrate xAI API for AI text generation:
Create an endpoint to handle AI requests and return generated text.
Add error handling for API failures.


 Implement role-based access control for collaboration (editor, viewer roles).
 Set up data encryption (HTTPS, database encryption).
 Write unit tests for API endpoints using a framework like Jest.

## Phase 3: Frontend Development

1. Set up React project with Vite or Create React App.
2. Configure Tailwind CSS for styling.
3. Create reusable UI components:
4. TextInput, Textarea, RichTextEditor.
5. DynamicTable (for budget breakdown).
6. Button (Save, Export, AI).
7. Sidebar (step navigation).
8. ProgressBar.
9. Build the multi-step form:
10. Scope section (client name, contact info, project title, summary, goals, deliverables).
11. Budget section (total, breakdown table, narrative).
12. Qualifications section (background, team members, experience, testimonials).
13. Implement form validation:
Real-time checks for required fields and valid formats (e.g., email).
Display user-friendly error messages.


 Create the split-screen layout:
Form on the left, real-time preview on the right.
Toggle preview for mobile devices.


 Develop the real-time preview:
Render form data in a professional proposal format (headers, tables, formatted text).
Ensure instant updates as users type.


 Implement navigation:
Sidebar with clickable steps.
Next/Previous buttons.
Progress indicator (e.g., "Step 1 of 3").


 Add AI text generation:
AI button next to each textarea/rich text editor.
Modal or inline input for context.
Display generated text with accept/edit/regenerate options.


 Implement Save functionality:
Save button in upper-right corner.
Auto-save every 30 seconds or on step change.
Store drafts via API.


 Implement Export functionality:
Export button with PDF and Word options.
Use jsPDF for PDF generation.
Use docx.js for Word generation.
Ensure exported files match preview styling.


 Build the dashboard:
List saved proposals with edit/duplicate/delete options.
Add "New Proposal" button with template selection.


 Add branding features:
Upload logo.
Set brand colors/fonts.


 Ensure responsiveness for desktop, tablet, and mobile.
 Implement accessibility (WCAG 2.1):
Keyboard navigation.
Screen reader support.
ARIA labels.


 Write unit tests for components using React Testing Library.

## Phase 4: Integration and Testing

1.  Connect frontend to backend APIs.
2.  Test AI integration with xAI API for text generation accuracy.
3.  Perform end-to-end testing:
4. Create a proposal from start to finish.
5. Test navigation, validation, preview, save, and export.
6. Test collaboration features (multi-user editing).
7.  Test performance:
        Ensure <100ms latency for form inputs and preview updates.
        Stress test with multiple concurrent users.
8. Test security:
        Verify data encryption.
    Test authentication and role-based access.
9. Conduct cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
10.  Perform usability testing with sample users.

## Phase 5: Deployment

1.  Deploy backend to hosting platform (e.g., AWS, Firebase).
2.  Deploy frontend to Vercel or Firebase Hosting.
3.  Set up CDN for React dependencies (e.g., cdn.jsdelivr.net).
4.  Configure environment variables for production (e.g., API keys).
5.  Set up monitoring and logging (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Firebase Analytics).
6.  Perform final production testing.

## Phase 6: Post-Launch

 Create user documentation (e.g., help center, FAQs).
 Implement onboarding:
Guided tutorial or tooltips for first-time users.


 Gather user feedback for improvements.
 Plan future enhancements:
CRM integrations (e.g., Salesforce).
E-signature functionality.
Analytics dashboard.


 Set up monetization:
Freemium model (limited proposals for free, unlimited for premium).
Integrate payment gateway (e.g., Stripe).



Notes

Prioritize tasks based on MVP (Minimum Viable Product) requirements: core form, preview, AI text, save/export.
Regularly review progress and adjust tasks as needed.
Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
